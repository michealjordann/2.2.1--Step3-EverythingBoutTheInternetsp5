                    <td>Email is an effective communication method to send information to other digital users. Email is useful for sending data files, ensuring you have a physical copy of the conversation (in case you need to refer to it later), communicating with a large number of people, and it isn’t time-sensitive.</td>

This allowed emails to be sent from one computer to another. He used the User@host system to determine who the user was and their intended electronic destination.</td>

                    <td>Ray Tomlinson is credited with developing the email, but Shiva Ayyaduari continued refining his innovation after his death. Initially, MIT computer scientists created MAILBOX, a computer software program, to send messages between computers in the same lab, but it was time-consuming. Then, Ray Tomlinson created a series of experiments to allow emails to be sent through the ARPANET. First, he produced two messaging programs on the PDP-10 computer to share and receive emails. Then, he created CPYNET to combine the essence of the SNDMSG and READMAIL file transfer systems into one that mitigated the time-sharing issue.</td>

                    <td>A computing innovation is “an innovation that includes a computer or program code as an integral part of its functionality”. The email can only be accessed through computers and the code behind the file transfer systems allows emails to be sent and received by people across different devices connected to the internet.</td>
